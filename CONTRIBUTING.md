# Contributing

Thank you for interest in Wave!

_For now_, Wave is mostly not open to contributions. If you find a bug, have a feature request, or similar, please open an [issue](https://github.com/jtrivedi/Wave/issues). This policy may change over time, but is currently designed to reduce the maintainance overhead of Wave.

In your issue, please provide a clear description of the issue/request, and if applicable, steps to reproduce the issue and motivation behind the feature request.
